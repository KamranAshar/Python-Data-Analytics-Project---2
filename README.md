We're all about using Python to analyze real data, especially when it comes to cars. Our project centers on a big dataset filled with details about different cars.

Commands Used in This Project:

1. import pandas as pd: Importing the Pandas library.
2. pd.read_csv: Importing the CSV file in Jupyter notebook.
3. head(): Displaying the first N rows in the data (by default, N=5).
4. df.isnull().sum(): Detecting the missing values from each column of the dataframe.
5. fillna(): Filling the null values of a column with a specific value.
6. value_counts: Showing all the unique values in a column with their count. It can be applied to a single column only.
7. isin(): Displaying all records including particular elements.
8. This README provides a quick reference for the commands used in the project for data analysis with Python.
